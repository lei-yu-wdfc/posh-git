We remove the complexity and inflexibility that businesses face whenever they need to borrow some cash in a hurry to support their business growth and needs.";

We are the first company in the world to fully automate the business lending process and we are able to make completely objective and responsible decisions around the clock. There’s no paperwork, meetings with bank managers or hanging on the phone – our entire service is online and real-time. We are also uniquely flexible, allowing business applicants to choose exactly how much cash they want to borrow and for how many weeks they need it. Our business customers aren't forced to borrow a fixed sum they might not need, or pay interest for any longer than necessary.";

Once an application is approved, we can deposit the money straight into a business bank account within one business day – and as little as 15 minutes depending on the bank in question.  Even collection is hassle-free, as we take a weekly repayment via continuous payment authority using your business debit card on the agreed day for the agreed term.";
